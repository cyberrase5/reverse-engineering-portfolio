# Cyberrase5 Reverse Engineering Projects Portfolio

My portfolio of reverse engineering projects. This repository contains detailed write-ups of binaries I've reversed. Each project folder contains a report of my analysis and the tools used.

Smaller the prefix number, newer the report. This way, the newest (and most relevant) will be at the top.

## Projects

| Project Name   | Description                                     | Tools Used |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| [999-Very Easy Crackme](999-very-easy-crackme) | Very basic login crackme | Ghidra |

## Notes
- Difficulties listed in reports are taken from the site at the time of writing the report
